Inner- and Outer Recursive Neural Networks for Chemoinformatics
=================================================================

This is a software package containing two types of recursive neural networks for molecular property predictions based on SMILES. 
While both models ca solve the same problems, their inner workings are vastly different. 


#### General Information

Both packages require either Python 2 or Python 3 and Tensorflow or Theano. 
They can both operate on GPUs and also in a CPU-only mode.
